Add to start.sh 

exec_path=$(readlink -f <where is the wpa_supplicant?>)

(You can choose by default to be P2P-GO or just start WiFi Direct
and then role will be decided after the negotiation).

defconfig is the configuration for wpa_supplicant.
just change it to ".config" and compile wpa_supplicant.
